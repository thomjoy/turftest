# turftest
Playing around with turf.js

### TODO

##### UI
- signify where the current stop is in the route (i.e stop 5/18 or maybe %age as total distance).
- when marker in radius is actioned, fade other markers.
- double click to move the 'you' marker to anywhere on the map
- show all routes from a stop (different colour polylines?)


- get geolocation working
- how to get gps access on a mobile device?
- can we get traffic data?
- given a location (say, from using the directions api) can we find the best bus stop?
- can we filter out stops in radius which are the end of a route?
- offload some of the turf compute into webworkers?

- whether or not you'd make it to the stop for the next bus, based on your distance from the stop? (confidence rating)
